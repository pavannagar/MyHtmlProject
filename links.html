	<p>. Chemical Equilibrium
1. Study the shift in equilibrium between ferric ions and thiocyanate ions by
increasing/decreasing the concentration of either ions.
2. Study the shift in <a href="chemistry.pdf">chemistry</a> equilibrium between [Co(H2O)6]
2+and chloride ions by
changing the concentration of either of the ions.
